# Reactance

A resistance game helper written in react.

# Use
Run `make` to build the javascript and css bundles.
Then navigate to index.html in your browser.

# Development
You can run `make js` and `make less` to build the bundles.
But you might find it more convenient to run
`make watch` to continuously build javascript
and `make watch-less` to continuously build css.
